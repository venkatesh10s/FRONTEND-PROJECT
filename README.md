# Interactive Portfolio Web Page  
### Frontend Development Journey – Day 7 to Day 8  
Created as part of my web development training at **Novi Tech**.

## About the Project  
This is a simple, interactive portfolio-style web page built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
The project introduces basic DOM manipulation to create an engaging experience:

- A welcome message with my name is shown first.  
- Clicking the **"Explore"** button reveals my image and skillset dynamically.  

It’s clean, responsive, and designed to demonstrate foundational frontend skills.

## Features  
-  Interactive **“Explore”** button that shows new content  
-  Clean layout with personal introduction and skill section  
-  Styled using **modern CSS** (flex, spacing, hover effects)  
-  Fully **responsive design** across devices  

## What I Learned  
-  JavaScript DOM manipulation and events  
-  Organizing JavaScript logic for UI behavior  
-  Structuring responsive portfolio layouts  
-  Combining **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JS** for real projects  

## Tech Stack  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
